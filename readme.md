# gimana2

_gimana2_ is a Chrome extension that displays audio transcription of web content. Since not all Youtube videos offers captioning,_gimana2_ provides a way for people who prefers text to understand the content.

_Important notice: the app listens to sound directly from your computer's mic, so be sure to be someplace quiet for better results_
